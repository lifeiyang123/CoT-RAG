Q: Can voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny each get one stripe from American flag?
A: Please refer to the above example. You need to generate a specific Question Decomposition Meaning Representation Graph for the given Question, which describes the complete logic of Question solving. In the Question Decomposition Meaning Representation Graph, nodes are different sub - questions. By indicating the parent node, the relationship between different nodes, i.e. the relationship between different sub - questions, can be explained.
You need to pay attention to the following points:
(1) The Question Decomposition should be as fine-grained as possible.
(2) For different sub - questions, overlapping between different sub - questions should be avoided.
(3) When you generate a new sub - question(that is, a sub node), you should identify all the preorder sub - questions related to it and place them in the Parent information.
(4) During the process of Question Decomposition, you can set new variables and equations at any time to help solve the Question.


Q: Can voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny each get one stripe from American flag?
QDMR:
Node#1: How many people have been the voice of Goofy?; Parent: {}
Node#2: How many people have been the voice of Bugs Bunny?; Parent: {}
Node#3: What is Node#1 plus Node#2?; Parent: {Node#1,Node#2}
Node#4: How many stripes does the American flag have?; Parent: {}
Node#5: Is Node#4 equal to or greater than Node#3?; Parent: {Node#3,Node#4}
A: Please refer to the above example. You need to use the <<Question Decomposition Meaning Representation Graph>> to generate a specific <<Answer>> for the <<Question>>.
You need to pay attention to the following points:
(1) You should solve the sub - question in the topological order of the <<Question Decomposition Meaning Representation Graph>>, that is sequentially solve sub - question 1, 2, 3, ...(Node#1,Node#2,Node#3,...).
(2) When solving each sub - question[Node#i], you should rely on its parent information. Repeat the solution result of the related pre - order sub - questions to limit the solution space of the sub - question[Node#i] to their relevant contextual environment.
(3) In the <<Question Decomposition Meaning Representation Graph>>, the solution result to the last sub - question is the answer to the original <<Question>>.
